Hello! My name is Elias. Welcome to my website!

I am a creative individual with my hands in two fields of work and many different projects. Since I was seven years old I have spent much of my time playing music. Time as a musician has given me the opportunity to connect and create art with people from around the world.

On the other hand I have always been interested in technical things, computers and how they work. As a kid, I used to open up and fiddle around with different electronic devices and change software on my computer to make it behave like I wanted it too.

I have also been fortunate enough to study music both at the Royal College of Music in Stockholm and the Sibelius-Academy in Helsinki.

I have played music since I was seven years old, having both studied a bachelor's degree at the Royal College of Music in Stockholm and master's at the Sibelius-Academy in Helsinki.
