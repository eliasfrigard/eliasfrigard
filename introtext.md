Hello! My name is Elias. Welcome to my website!

I am a creative individual with my hands in two fields of work and many different projects. Since I was seven years old I have spent much of my time playing music. Time as a musician has given me the opportunity to connect and create art with people from around the world.

Another part of me has always been interested in technical things, computers and how they work. As a kid, I used to open up and fiddle around with different electronic devices and change software on my computer to make it do what I wanted it to.

This website is the culmination of many years of work, studies and creation. Use the links below to find out more information about me as a musician or as a software developer.

Today, I live in Helsinki, Finland where I studied a master's degree in music at the Sibelius-Academy. Before that, I lived in Stockholm where I studied at the Royal College of Music. I also studied computer science

If you are interested in my work as a software developer

I have also been fortunate enough to study music both at the Royal College of Music in Stockholm and the Sibelius-Academy in Helsinki.

I have played music since I was seven years old, having both studied a bachelor's degree at the Royal College of Music in Stockholm and master's at the Sibelius-Academy in Helsinki.
